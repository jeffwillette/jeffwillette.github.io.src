## A Logarithm

<BlockMath math="3 = log_2(8) \implies 2^3 = 8" />

A logarithm is an algebraic way to look at an exponent. It just takes the terms
and re-arranges them in another way. Before computers were too common, it was used to handily compute long
multiplication problems.

To do this, you need to use a log table, which is just a table of numbers where you can find what exponent to raise
the number 10 to in order to achieve a desired outcome. For example, in the referenced table below, if you wanted to
find the solution to the equation below,

<BlockMath math="10_x = 2 \; or \; x = log_{10}(2)" />

you would go to the log table and go down the column on the left hand side until you hit 20 (some of these tables
would say 20 and some of them would say 2, probably because people prefer not to look at decimal points) and then you
would go over to the correct column that dictates the next decimal place after the 2. You will find yourself in the
appropriate spot to find the exponent which you must raise 10 to in order to get 2 as the result.

So looking at this table you can see that 10 raised to the .3010 will equal 2.00. What would you have to raise to to
<InlineMath math="10^{.3010} = 2.00" />
in order to get 2.01? To find this, you would do the same thing, but just move over to the next column (row 20 (which
is 2) and column 1). Then you know that 10^.3032 = 2.01. It seems pretty archaic, but long multiplication problems
were done this way before computers were too common.

In a more complex example , you can multiply something like 257.3 * 14.84 by following the steps here

When put into a calculator, I get a slightly different answer of 3818.3. That is because the log table I used only
went two decimal places when I actually needed three. I didn't go through the trouble of averaging them together to
figure out the exact decimal.
