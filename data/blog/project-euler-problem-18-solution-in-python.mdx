## The Problem States

```text
By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from
top to bottom is 23.

[3]
[7] 4
2 [4] 6
8 5 [9] 3

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:

75
95 64
17 47 82
18 35 87 10
20 04 82 47 65
19 01 23 75 03 34
88 02 77 73 07 63 67
99 65 04 28 06 16 70 92
41 41 26 56 83 40 80 70 33
41 48 72 33 47 32 37 16 94 29
53 71 44 65 25 43 91 52 97 51 14
70 11 33 28 77 73 17 78 39 68 17 57
91 71 52 38 17 14 91 43 58 50 27 29 48
63 66 04 68 89 53 67 30 73 16 69 87 40 31
04 62 98 27 23 09 70 98 73 93 38 53 60 04 23
```

NOTE:As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route. However,
[Problem 67](https://projecteuler.net/problem=67), is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows;
it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)

## My Solution

This one was also a little bit out of my math knowledge area so I had to do some researching. I found a simple way to
solve it, that at first, seems like it won't always give the right answer, but it will.

You start from the bottom and work your way upwards, instead of trying every route adding the numbers. For example,
it seems ridiculous with a 1x2 triangle...

```text
[1]
[1, 2]
```

If you start from the bottom, you can see which route will give the biggest sum without even trying. You simply have
to look at 1, and 2 and choose two because it is bigger. It would be no different if it were a bigger triangle and 1
was just two other numbers in the next level. for example...

```text
[3]            [3]           [3] >>>>   [27]

[3, 7]         [3, 7] >>>>   [20, 24]

[3, 8, 5] >>>> [12, 17, 8]

[6, 9, 3, 2]
```

So I first need to get the numbers in neat lists and then write a loop that will go through and add each bottom
number to the number right above it triangularly, and then pick the biggest of the two sums to be the new number in
the bottom row. Once I get to the top, there should only be one option left which is the sum of the route that gave
the greatest sum.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

the_number_file = open('Euler18-number.txt', 'r')
num = the_number_file.read()
the_number_file.close()

#My first loop, getting rid of the newlines and the spaces
the_list = []
double = 0
for i in num:
    if i == '\n' or i == ' ':
        pass
    else:
        the_list.append(i)
else:
    num = the_list

#This is my second loop that add the strings of num together again
the_list = []
skip = 0
for i in num:
    while skip < 240:
    the_list.append(int(num[skip] + num[skip + 1]))
    skip += 2
else:
    num = the_list

#Third loop applying each number set of numbers into a sub-list to print like a triangle
the_list = []
start = 0
gap = 1
count = 1
for i in num:
    while start < 120:
    the_list.append(num[start:gap])
    start = gap
    count += 1
    gap += count

#Printing list to make sure it's right. Everything under this will be solving the problem
num = the_list
for i in num:
    print(i)

print()

#It starts at the bottom right and picks the max sum, then works its way through the row, when it hits the else
#condition, it will move up one row and repeat the same until there is nothing left. I used two for loops so
#it would iterate through the list and then through the sub-lists

bot = 14
rit = 14
the_list = []
for i in num:
    for j in num:
        if rit >= 1:
            num[bot-1][rit-1] += max(num[bot][rit], num[bot][rit-1])
            rit -= 1
        elif rit == 0:
            rit = bot-1
            bot -= 1

for i in num:
     print(i)

print('the max value is:', num[0])
print()
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```
