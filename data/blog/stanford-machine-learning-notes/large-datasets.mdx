When working with large datasets, it can be computationally expensive, so it is best to figure out how many training
examples you need before training with all of the examples.

- try different values of m and plot the errors with the training set and cross validation set
- if there is a large gap between the errors tat is closing, then training with more examples may help
- if the gap closes quickly, it may be better to train with only a small subset.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent

As opposed to batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent works on only one example at a time. This can avoid
having to load the entire dataset into memory when running gradient descent. Because it doesn't have the advantage of
seeing the entire dataset on every run, it may take a more roundabout way when finding the minimum. For this reason, it
may be necessary to run through the data multiple times.

<M b="\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha (h_\theta(x)^{(i)} - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)}" />

random_shuffle(data)

for 1:num_passes
  for i:m
    theta - theta - alpha * derivative_of_cost_function
  endfor
endfor
```

## Mini-batch Gradient Descent

Instead of performing a full batch gradient descent, we can get the best of both worlds by loading less data into memory
and still doing a vectorized calculation with mini batch gradient descent

<M b="
\begin{aligned}
  &b = 10 \quad m = 1000 \\
  &\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{1}{10} \sum_{k=1}^{i + 9} (h_\theta(x^{(k)}) - y^{(k)})x^{(k)}_j
\end{aligned}
" />

## Checking For Convergence

- compute the cost before updating theta
- every so often (maybe every 1000 iterations) plot the average cost over the last 1000 iterations

If seeing non expected learning curves, try plotting the values over a different amount of iterations to either make a
more noisy (fewer iterations) or more stable (more iterations) average of the curve.

The learning rate can also be changed to be <M i="const / iterations + const"/> in order to deacrease alpha
as the number of iterations goes up. Without this, stochastic gradient descent is likely to meander around the minimum
instead of converging at the optimum since it doesn't have the advantage of seeing the entire training set at once.
