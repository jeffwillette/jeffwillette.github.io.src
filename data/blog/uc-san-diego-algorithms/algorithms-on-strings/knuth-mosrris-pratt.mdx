Knuth-Morris-Pratt is a string searching algorithm that runs in linear time of the sum of the length of the pattern that
is being searched and the length of the text. In order to do this, it used some smart methods to search for places in
the string where it can skip searching by default instead of going along and searching by every character of the text.

> A **border** of string <M i="S" /> is a prefix of <M i="S" /> which is equal to a suffix of <M i="S" />, but not equal
> to the whole <M i="S" />.

- `a` is a border of `arba`
- `ab` is a border of `abcdab`
- `abab` is a border of `ababab`
- `ab` is not a border of `ab` (because there is no suffix that matches a prefix)

## Prefix Function

This is a function of a string that returns the length of the longest border for each index of the string

<M b="\begin{bmatrix}
    a & b & a & b & a & b & c & a & a & b \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
\end{bmatrix}" />

In the above example, the first two indices have no border, but for the third index, there is a border length of 1
because `aba` has a border of `a`. The 4th index has a border of `ab` which is of length 2. This continues counting the
border lengths, sometimes the borders overlap each other which is accepted. The first overlap occurs where the number 3
is shown (`aba` border of length 3 overlaps itself in `ababa`)

> All border can be enumerated by taking the longest border and searching for sub borders of the longest border.

Since the prefix function finds the longest border, it can be called on the longest border to find the longest
sub-borders all the way down until there is an empty border.

```text
ComputePrefixFunction(P)
  s <- array of integers of length |P|
  s[0] <- 0, border <- 0
  for i from 1 to |P| - 1:
    while border > 0 and P[i] != P[border]:
    # here we undo the border increment because the current character cannot make it longer
      border <- s[border - 1]
    if P[i] == P[border]:
      border <- border + 1
    else:
      border <- 0
    s[i] <- border
  return s
```

This constructs the prefix in linear time because the inner while loop is guaranteed to only run a linear amount of
times. This is because the border length only increases by one on each iteration of the for loop and the while loop at
most takes it back to `0` so it cannot run more than <M i="|P|" /> times total.

## Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm

In order to use the prefix function to find a pattern in text, we can assemble the pattern and the text together and
then run the prefix function on the concatenated string (the pattern is the prefix) and then go through and find all of
the locations where the prefix length matches the length of the pattern.

```text
FindAllOccurences(P, T)
  S <- P + "$" + T
  s <- ComputePrefixFunction(S)
  result <- empty list
  for i from |P| + 1 to |S| - 1:
    if s[i] == |P|:
      result.append(i - 2|P|) # this is the starting position of the match in S
  return result
```
