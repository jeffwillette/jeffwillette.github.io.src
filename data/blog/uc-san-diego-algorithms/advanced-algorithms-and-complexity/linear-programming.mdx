## Degrees of Freedom

- solution set will be a subspace
- dimension = number of free variables
- each equation gives one variable in terms of others
- generally, dimensions = num variables - num equations (if each equation gives solution of one variable in terms of the
  others)

## Gaussian Elimination

We can store the coefficients from the linear equation in a matrix.

<M b="
  \begin{aligned}
    x + y = 5 \\
    2x + 4y = 12 \\
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 1 & 5 \\
        2 & 4 & 12 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
  \end{aligned}
" />

The linear equations represented by the matrix can be solved by using the following algorithm

```text
RowReduce(A)
  find row where leftmost column is not 0 and not a previous pivot
  swap this row to the top of the unused pivot rows
  make entry pivot (remember which column we are solving for)
  rescale to make pivot = 1
  subtract row from others to make other entries in column 0
  repeat for other columns until there are no more non-zero unused columns
```

- once an equation is used as a pivot, it cannot be used in further equations
- if the coefficient is 0, the column cannot be used as a pivot
- with <M i="m"/> equations and  <M i="n"/> variables, the runtime is  <M i="O(nm \; min(n, m))" />

## Polytopes

A system of linear equations defines a region bounded by hyperplanes. A hyperplane can be visualized as a linear
inequality for something like <M i="x < 0" /> where the boundary is a vertical line and everything on the x plane less
than 0 is acceptable.

- a **polytope** is a region in <M i="\reals^n" /> bounded by finitely many flat surfaces
- surfaces may intersect in lower dimensional facets (edges) with zero dimensional facets called vertices

<props.imgs.Img1 align="left" width="30%" />

A cube in 3 dimensional space would be such a polytope. Not all shapes are possible though because each hyperplane is a
linea inequality. A doughnut shape, for example, would be impossible because there are no values which can satisfy the
requirement of being inside the doughnut without breaking some of the inequalities.

- the optimum is always at a vertex

## Convexity

<props.imgs.Img2 align="right" width="20%" />

A region <M i="C \subset \reals^n" /> is convex if for any <M i="x, y \in C" /> the line segment
connecting <M i="x"/>, and <M i="y" /> is contained in <M i="C" />

## Duality

if we have a linear program where we want to minimize the following equation with constraints
having <M i="n" /> variables and <M i="m" /> equations

<M b="
  \begin{aligned}
    &v_1x_1 + v_2x_2 + ... + v_nx_n \\
    &a_{11}x_1 + a_{12} x_2 ... + a_{1n}x_n \ge b_1 \\
    &... \\
    &a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + ... + a_{mn}x_n \ge b_m
  \end{aligned}
" />

if we have some constants that we can multiply each equation by, we can combine constraints

<M b="
  \begin{aligned}
    &c_1 [a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + ... + a_{1n}x_n \geq b1] \\
    &... \\
    + \; &c_m [a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + ... + a_{mn}x_n \geq b_m] \\ \hline
    &w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n \geq t \\
    \\
    &w_i = \sum c_j a_{ji}, \; t = \sum c_j b_j
  \end{aligned}
" />


> **TODO** do they have to be the same value to be added up?

meaning that we add up the columns of a values once they have been normalized with a constant, they can create a new
inequality

if <M i="w_i = v_i" /> for all <M i="i" />, we have <M i="v_1x_1 + v_2x_2 + ... + v_nx_n \ge t" />. and there is a lower
bound on the variable we are trying to minimize. We can then say that...

- we want to find <M i="c_i \ge 0" /> so that <M i="v_i = \sum_{j=1}^m c_j a_{ji}" /> for all <M i="i" />
  and <M i="t = \sum_{j=1}^m c_j b_j" />  is as large as possible.
