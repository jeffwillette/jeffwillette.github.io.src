## The Problem States

```text
Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6
routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?
```

## My Solution

This one was a bit out of my knowledge area so I had to do some researching on recursive paths. The conclusion I came
up with is that instead of trying to follow all the possible paths individually, which would take forever, I would
have to store the paths somehow. Take the following grid for example...

```text
[1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1]
```

I only have two options, move right or move down. That means that every move I make will build on the previous moves.
If I start at the top left '1' there is only one possible way to move to the right. Likewise if I move down, there is
only one way. But if Iwere to move right one and down one, I could also move down one and right one. Therefore there
are two ways to reach that point. If you follow this patter even further, you will see that every possible path to a
point in the graph is just a sum of the possible ways to make it to the point on the left and the point above it...

```text
[1, 1, 1]
[1, 2, 3]
[1, 3, 6]
```

The 3x3 grid I made above is the same as the example problem, because they are using corners, which makes the 2x2
squares more like a 3x3 grid in reality. If we were to do a 5 square example, it would look like this...

```text
[1, 1,  1,  1,  1]
[1, 2,  3,  4,  5]
[1, 3,  6, 10, 15]
[1, 4, 10, 20, 35]
[1, 5, 15, 35, 70]
```

The Problem became a whole lot easier to manage once I realized this, the rest of the code is pretty easy.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

#The grid, this function just creates a list within a list of all 1's that will be our grid
the_grid = []
def grid_size(l, h):
    length = [1] * l
    for i in length:
        height = [i] * h
        the_grid.append(height)
    return the_grid

length = 21
height = 21
grid = grid_size(length, height)

x = 0
y = 0
for row in grid:
    for i in grid:
        if x < (length - 1):
            grid[y+1][x+1] = grid[y+1][x] + grid[y][x+1]
            x += 1
        elif y < (height - 2):
            x = 0
            y += 1

print()
for i in grid:
    print(i)

print('the final answer is:', grid[20][20])
print()
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
